# generator-dapr

**NOTE**: This package is a work in progress and is not yet fully functional. 

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for scaffolding a [dapr](http://dapr.io) project.


## Installation

- `npm install -g generator-dapr`

## Usage

- `yo dapr`

## Building the Generator

If you're planning on forking or contributing, note that the generator is developed in TypeScript. Correspondingly, only the source code is included in this repo (in `src`). 

To build the code, run `npm run build`, which will compile the .ts files and copy all templates into an `app` directory, where Yeoman looks for them.

## Getting Started

See [dapr docs](https://github.com/dapr/docs) and [docr samples](https://github.com/dapr/samples) to get started.
